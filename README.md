### Status

As of August 2019 it successfully runs all the standard library tests.

As of November 2019 the Windows interface is mostly functional.

As of July 2020 the client portion is production ready to replace cSuneido.

As of March 2021 we are no longer using cSuneido, all customers are on gSuneido.<br/>
(as client, with jSuneido as the server)

The database portion is feature complete. stdlib tests all pass.
Still some bugs to find and fix.

### In Progress

Server side of client-server
